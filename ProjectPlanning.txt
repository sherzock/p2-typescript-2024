-------------- Main Idea --------------

- Use Pokeapi -> https://pokeapi.co/
- Pokeapi is an Api which returns information about Pokemon games.
- The Idea is to fetch several Pokemon with their information from the API.
- Then Create a base class from the information for each Pokemon
- Make a Page for each pokemon

-------------- Index Page Information --------------

Information I want to display about each pokemon in the index page.

- Name
- Picture or Sprite
- ID
- Types

-------------- Pokemon Page Information --------------

Information I want to Display about each pokemon:

- Name
- Picture or Sprite
- ID
- Types
- Regions
- Movements
- Evolutions

-------------- Development Planning --------------

1. Learn How PokeAPI works.
2. Get To Parse de necessary information from a JSON format
3. Create a Pokemon class to store all the necessary information
4. Create a base HTML page with TS.
5. Add The list of Pokemon to that Page.
6. Create a link to each pokemon page.
7. Create an HTML page using TS for each Pokemon.
8. Add style to the main Page.
9. Add styles to the Pokemon Page.


-------------- Things that can be added in the future --------------
